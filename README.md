# 04 Word Guess Game

## Description

This is an endeavor to develop a web app that presents JavaScript related statements and offers users to qualify the validity of the statement by clicking either a true or false button. The app is intended to run in a timed environment which attributes a numerical value(score) that recognizes both the speed and accuracy with which the user evaluates the statements. The users highest score is saved. 

Successful deployment of the app will demonstrate my understanding and ability to implement several web development utilities:

### Web APIs

- Timers and Intervals
- Event Listeners
- Local Storage

### JavaScript

- Variables
- Objects
- Arrays
- Math.random
- for loops
