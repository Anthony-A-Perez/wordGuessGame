# True/False Timed Quiz App

This is a True/False Timed Quiz App where players answer a series of questions within a 60-second time limit. The app awards points for correctly answered questions, deducts points for wrong answers, and subtracts fifteen seconds from the timer for wrong answers as well. Once the timer runs out or all the questions are answered, the game is over, and the player's score is rendered and added to a saved scores list along with their initials.
